## Background

Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a narrowing of the small blood vessels that supply blood and oxygen to the heart. CHD is also called coronary artery disease.

Coronary heart disease is caused by the buildup of plaque in the arteries to your heart. This may also be called hardening of the arteries.

  1. Fatty material and other substances form a plaque buildup on the walls of your coronary arteries.
  2. This buildup causes the arteries to get narrow.
  3. As a result, blood flow to the heart can slow down or stop.

A risk factor for heart disease is something that increases your chance of getting it. You cannot change some risk factors for heart disease, but you can change others.

## What an application provides

In order to help user to evaluate their risk of developing coronary heart disease and to ubderstand how to reduce the risk, I have developed this shiny app that allows the user to do the following through Shiny's easy to use user interface controls.

1. Perform an easy self evaluation based on some fact
2. Risk assesment 
3. Understand what life style that can reduce the risk

## How it works
1. This apps use the SAheart data set from the R package.
2. A multi variable glm model was build using featobacco, ldl, alcohol and age features.
3. user input of tobacco, ldl, alcohol and age was obtained through shiny user interface.
4. model prediction was performed at the server side and result printed in the interface.

## How it works, continued

2D plot of CHD risk and tobacco, ldl, alcohol and age from the SAheart data set.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(caret)
library(ElemStatLearn)
library(randomForest)
data(SAheart)
set.seed(8484)
train = as.data.frame(subset(SAheart, select= c("tobacco",  "ldl", "alcohol", "age", "chd")))
train$chd<-factor(train$chd)
plot(train)
```

## How it works, continued
The user interface:
User can input their tobacco, ldl, alcohol and age data in the left panel, the apps will then  grab the data and perform a model fitting in the server and retern the result and print on the right panel.
